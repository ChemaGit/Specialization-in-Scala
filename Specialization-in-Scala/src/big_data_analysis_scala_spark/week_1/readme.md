Getting Started + Spark Basics
Get up and running with Scala on your computer. Complete an example assignment to familiarize yourself with our unique way of submitting assignments. In this week, we'll bridge the gap between data parallelism in the shared memory scenario (learned in the Parallel Programming course, prerequisite) and the distributed scenario. We'll look at important concerns that arise in distributed systems, like latency and failure. We'll go on to cover the basics of Spark, a functionally-oriented framework for big data processing in Scala. We'll end the first week by exercising what we learned about Spark by immediately getting our hands dirty analyzing a real-world data set.
