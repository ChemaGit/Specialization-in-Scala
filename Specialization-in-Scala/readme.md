This repository contains code examples about the Specialization Course in Scala from Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne 
"Functional Programming in Scala Specialization".
Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne EPFL is the university where "Scala Language" is developed.
The Specialization Course in Scala is divided in five modules:
1. Principles of Functional Programming in Scala by Martin Ordesky. 
   Martin Ordesky is the creator of the Scala language. He is a professor at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland, 
   where since 2001 he has led the team that developed the Scala language libraries and compiler.
   The primary objective of the course is to learn functional programming from first principles.
   The course show us function programs, methods to construct them, and ways to reason about them.
   Functional programming just means programming without mutable variables, without assignments to those variables, 
   without loops and the other imperative control structures. Functional programming also means focusing on the functions in the program.
   We can define a function anywhere including inside other functions. We can pass a function as a parameter to another function and return it, 
   as a result from a function. Why Functional Programming? because it's very good for exploiting parallelism on multi call and cloud computing,
   so functional programming is important for parallelism and concurrency.
   Scala is a mix between Functional, Imperative and Object-Oriented programming paradigm.
   The course is full of quizzes, examples, exercises and assignments.
   Recommended books: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, by Harold Ibelson and Gerald Susman, 
   second edition appeared at MIT Press in'96. Programming in Scala second edition, by Martiy Ordesky, Lex Spoon, and Bill Venners.
2. Functional Program Design in Scala by Martin Ordesky.
   In this course we will learn how to apply the functional programming style in the design of larger applications. 
   We'll get to know important new functional programming concepts, from lazy evaluation to structuring libraries using  monads.
   We'll work on larger and more involved examples, from state space exploration to random testing to discrete circuit simulators.
   We’ll also learn some best practices on how to write good Scala code in the real world.
   Several parts of this course deal with the question how functional programming interacts with mutable state. We will explore the
   consequences of combining functions and state. We will also look at purely functional alternatives to mutable state, using
   infinite data structures or functional reactive programming.
   Learning Outcomes:
	 - recognize and apply design principles of functional programs,
	 - design functional libraries and their APIs,
	 - competently combine functions and state in one program,
	 - understand reasoning techniques for programs that combine 
	   functions and state,
	 - write simple functional reactive applications.
3. Parallel Programming in Scala by Dr. Aleksandar Prokopec, Principal Researcher and Prof. Viktor Kuncak, Associate Professor at 
   Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne.
   In this course, you will learn  the basics of parallel computing, both from a theoretical and
   a practical aspect. You will see how many familiar ideas from  functional programming map perfectly to the data parallel 
   paradigm. 
   Concretely, you will learn about paralleling known algorithms such as merge sort or Monte Carlo methods. You will also discover 
   some new algorithms, like parallel reduction, or parallel perfect sum. 
   This knowledge applies to practical problems. Graphics processing, parsing or particle simulation. These are all algorithms that 
   you will implement in Scala using programming primitives from the standard library.
   Our lectures contrast parallel programming with sequential programming in Scala that you're already familiar with. We explore 
   conditions that make a parallel program compute the same result as its sequential counterpart.  
   In terms of performance, you will learn how to estimate it analytically, as well as how to measure it for your implementations.
   Throughout, we'll apply these concepts through several hands-on examples that analyze real-world data, such as popular   
   algorithms like k-means clustering.
   - reason about task and data parallel programs,
   - express common algorithms in a functional style and solve them in parallel,
   - competently microbenchmark parallel code,
   - write programs that effectively use parallel collections to achieve performance
